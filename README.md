## Overview
There are product review websites for different consumer products: tech gear, cars, makeup etc. When it comes to gender affirming products for trans folks, the community is often left to crawl through endless list-icles, social media groups and forums to find reviews by other community members.

My idea for **genderbender** is a centralized product review site where community members can leave comments about products they love (or not).

(The inspiration of the name is from me getting fooled by the Spotify-curated playlist named "Genre Bender" every single time and getting too excited for a split second.)

## Planning and Problem Solving
### Pages
The final deliverable diverged slightly from the wireframe in that the sign up and log in pages are on separate pages, instead of on the same page as shown below.

## Design
![genderbender logo](/static/images/genderbender-logo-whiteBG-narrow.png)
The genderbender logo comprises of three colors (mustard, turquoise, and pink) and three shapes (circle, triangle, square). The three colors are a spin on the primary colors (yellow, blue, red). Whereas the three shapes are a deconstruction of the shapes used to convey "male" and "female" on bathroom signs, and somewhat reminiscent of shapes in kids wooden block toys.

I see sex, gender and gender expression as things we have yet to deconstruct in society, but it doesn't mean we can't have a bit of fun in the process!

## Potential Future Development
- Allowing users to upload their images along with review
- Allowing users to specify the color/ size of product they bought which will be displayed alongside the reviews
- Adding tags to products so they can be filtered on the landing page, and for users to be able to view similar products to the one they are currently looking at
